    <h1>Machine Learning Fundamentals</h1>
    <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
    <p>Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to make predictions or decisions based on data.</p>
    <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Supervised Learning:</b> Training algorithms to make predictions based on labeled data.</li>
        <li><b>Unsupervised Learning:</b> Training algorithms to identify patterns or structure in unlabeled data.</li>
        <li><b>Reinforcement Learning:</b> Training algorithms to make decisions based on rewards or penalties.</li>
    </ul>
